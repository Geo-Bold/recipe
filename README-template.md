## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although quite a simple project, this allowed me to polish my HTML and CSS skills while practice initializing, pushing and committing to Git. 


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand and remember the flexbox rule sets.
